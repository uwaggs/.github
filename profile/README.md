### Who are we?

The **University of Waterloo Analytics Group for Games and Sports (UWAGGS)** was established in 2023 to mobilize and advance sports analytics research and learning for students, staff, faculty, and community members at the University of Waterloo.

### Why are we here?

Our main objectives are to **facilitate collaboration** on projects and teams for hackathons and competitions, **share resources** for tutorials and workshops to enhance our breadth of data science applications to sport, **attend seminars** from respected members of the sports analytics community, and **present research** at and attend conferences.

### What do we do?

We host **bi-weekly hybrid sessions** with presentations on statistical applications of data across different domains of sport. We also send **weekly emails** with information about analytics conferences and competitions. We **maintain channels** for students who desire to work together and **publicize student projects** wherever possible for public visibility. Finally, we share external **co-op and internship opportunities** in the sports analytics industry with our members.

### How are we doing?

As of Spring 2024, UWAGGS has received interest from **over 180** students representing **all 6 faculties** across campus, as well as members from several other universities across Canada. Our members have presented research and projects at conferences in Canada, the United States, and Europe. **Over 35 sport** and game disciplines are represented in the club, including soccer, hockey, baseball, basketball, and many e-sports.
